## üñºÔ∏è GUI Experience

This project offers a native desktop UI, designed with a focus on clarity, responsiveness, and modularity. Below are the major GUI components:

- ‚úÖ **Login Window with Google OAuth**  
  Opens the system browser to authenticate with Google, and displays clear status messages after login.

- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Panel with Tabs or Sections**  
  Organized into cards/sections like:
  - Profile Overview
  - Customer Summary
  - Task Reminders

- ‚úÖ **Animated Transitions (Optional)**  
  You can enable smooth fade-in transitions or sliding panels using `QPropertyAnimation` or `QGraphicsOpacityEffect`.

- ‚úÖ **Custom Styling**  
  Styled with Qt's built-in stylesheet system (`QSS`) to resemble modern UI themes.

> Screenshots will be updated soon.
